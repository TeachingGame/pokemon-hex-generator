# Instructions

1. Ensure your text speed is set to "Fast" and your game is set to automatically send Pokemon to the box
2. You must start with a full party with no eggs
3. Make sure you're set to the first box you'd like to fill
4. Ensure that your Rotom bike is *fully upgraded*
5. Go to the Route 5 Daycare and charge up your Rotom bike boost
6. Cycle to the *left side* of the nursery worker
7. Plug in the bot to begin the loop

**Notes:**
* You won't collect an egg every cycle - this is normal
* It's recommended to have the Oval Charm and two Pokemon with different trainer IDs in the Daycare to maximize chances of receiving an egg
* If both the above conditions are met, you will collect about 80% of the target number of eggs

## Configuration Options

### m_maxCycle
The number of times to attempt to collect an egg. Note that you will not get an egg every time, so this is not the exact number of eggs that will be collected.
