# Instructions

1. Activate Y-Comm glitch and ensure your system time is unsynced
2. Set your current Switch date to January 1, or the first of any month that has 31 days
3. Start the bot over the date selection menu item

**Note:** This version of the date-skipper only changes the day, not the month or year. This is intended. It knows not to count the change from 31 to 1.

## Configuration Options

### m_JP_EU_US
The system time format. 0 = JP, 1 = EU, 2 = US

### m_dayToSkip
Number of days to skip
