# Instructions

1. Activate the Y-Comm glitch and ensure your system time is unsynced
2. Ensure you've set your current Switch date and number of days to skip in the Config file - your current date *must* be between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2060
3. Start the bot over the date selection menu item

**Note:** This script will skip a maximum of 22280 days. If you want to skip more than that, look at the DaySkipper_Unlimited instead.
