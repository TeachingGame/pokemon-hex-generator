# Instructions

1. Ensure that text speed is set to "Fast" and that your system time is unsynced
2. Face the wishing piece den, with Watts collected, on your bike. Save in this position
3. Plug in the bot to begin the loop

The bot will skip 3 frames and then ring the bike bell several times. This is your cue to look at the Switch - it will then check the den and pause for a few seconds. If it's the Pokemon you want, simply unplug the bot. If not, leave it alone and it will restart and roll again.
