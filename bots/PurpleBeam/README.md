# INSTRUCTIONS
* Set text speed to fast
* Ride bike in front of den and save
* Make sure the den has no watts to collect
* Have at least 1 wishing piece
* Plug in the bot to begin the loop

The bot will ring the bike bell to get your attention before putting a wishing piece in the den and then clicking home before the game can save. It waits for a few seconds, closes the game, reopening the game and repeating the loop.
Makes rerolling for purple beam easier without having the risk of pressing home too slowly and wasting wishing pieces.
Note that you will NOT see the purple beam itself because the home menu is entered faster than it shows up. Instead, watch for the absence of red streaks from the den.
