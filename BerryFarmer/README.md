# Instructions

1. Activate the Y-Comm glitch and ensure that your system time is unsynced
2. Ensure that your text speed is set to "Fast"
3. Make sure that you are standing in front of a berry tree - don't do the ones near Greedent between Bridge Field and Stony Wilderness
4. Ensure that you are not on your bike (more reliable)

Because doing many date skips can cause the game to crash, the bot will save every so often for safety. It takes approximately 17 seconds per berry collection.

## Configuration Options

### m_JP_EU_US
The date format of your Switch. 0 = JP, 1 = EU, 2 = US

### m_saveAt
